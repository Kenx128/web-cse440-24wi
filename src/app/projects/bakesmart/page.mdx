## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Baking, while therapeutic for many, can also be a source of frustration and anxiety due to its demanding requirements 
of precision and the need for proper tools. This dichotomy highlights the critical role of community support in the baking 
journey. Recognizing this need, there arises a constant demand for a flexible learning platform tailored to bakers of all 
skill levels, aimed at fostering personalized skill development in the art of baking.

Enter BakeSmart - a comprehensive solution in the form of an app – designed to address the challenges faced by the baking community. 
Through extensive research and interviews, our team identified a significant gap: the absence of a unified platform that seamlessly 
integrates personal skill development and community building. BakeSmart fills this void by providing bakers with a space to chart 
their journey towards success while fostering connections with peers. By offering a wide range of functionalities, 
BakeSmart encourages individuals to embark on their baking journey or nurture novice bakers, 
ensuring that the passion for baking thrives under the guidance of professionals.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

The overall goal of our design research is better understanding the baking processes 
among professional, novice, and non bakers, focusing on how our project can help 
bridge the gap between different levels of bakers, ultimately demystifying the 
complexities of baking. Our research method involves conducting interviews with bakers
of different skill levels, and baking observations with novice bakers. The interviews 
among the bakers allowed us to examine the unique perspectives and consider the diverse 
needs and expectations of our intended users. By directly observing the novice bakers, 
we can gain a comprehensive understanding of their behaviors and thought process in 
the act of baking. Through our design research, we have found the overarching themes 
to be centered around the need for a structured approach to baking for novices, inspired 
by the methodologies of professional bakers to bridge the gap between novices and professionals. 
Novices would benefit from a community to discuss outcomes and user-friendly ways to record their 
baking sessions, which could accelerate their learning curve. The three key insights that could 
provide novice bakers the proper structure to aid their journey to baking expertise are:

### The Methodical Approach

Echoing the discipline of professional bakers, there is an urgent need for novices to adopt, 
or have access to a platform that offers, a more methodical approach to their baking endeavors.

### User-Friendly Documentation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x4001,
            alt: "Methodical approach for users to follow as they start baking something.",
            caption: "Methodical approach for users to follow as they start baking something.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x4002,
            alt: "User Friendly documentation for the users to continue on the journey easily.",
            caption: "User Friendly documentation for the users to continue on the journey easily.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The path to perfection is paved with the notes of past experiments. 
Facilitating a user-friendly way to document (and easily review) their baking process 
will empower novices to find their way to success.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### The Power of Community

Novices are in dire need of a baking community where they can share, learn, and grow – a digital 
'sourdough starter', if you will. Within this community, novices can seek advice from professionals, 
while professionals could gain fresh new perspectives from novices, such as learning a new recipe from 
a different culture, thus elevating the baking experience for all through reciprocal exchange.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

From our design research process, we narrowed our design focus down to two key tasks 
that our design aims to accomplish: Choosing a Recipe from baking skills or a baking 
quest, and Baking and Refining a Recipe. To start our iterative design process, we 
created a paper prototype that went through heuristic inspection and usability testing. 
From these tests, we found that our participants thought positively of the methodical 
approach, the availability of community, and the ease of documentation presented in 
our design. However, from these three insights found from our design research, our 
participants were left wanting clarity from some of them or a greater emphasis on 
them from others. The feedback received from our participants lead us to three key 
insights we improved on: Linear Baking Quest, Accessibility towards Community 
Engagement, and Simple Recipe Editing Process.

### Linear Baking Quest

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8001,
        alt: "We have gradually improved from confusing tree progression to linear progression that locks the previous progress levels as the user finishes it.",
    }}
    caption={
        "We have gradually improved from confusing tree progression to linear progression that locks the previous progress levels as the user finishes it."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Prior to the development of the linear baking quest, our design had a non-linear web 
design for our baking quest. During the heuristic test, our participant found that the
web design may be “too confusing” and had potential visibility problems, violating the 
multiple heuristics but notably, 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design. In our revised paper 
prototype and later our digital design, we switched to a linear quest approach commonly seen 
in other mobile educational applications, improving the usability of the design.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Accesibility towards Community Engagement

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8003,
        alt: "Our community page before usability testing (on paper) and after testing (digital version)",
    }}
    caption={
        "Our community page before usability testing (on paper) and after testing (digital version)"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Prior to implementing greater accessibility to our community page, our design only 
had a few places that could access the community tab. During a usability test, our 
participant found that the community tab seemed like an “essential component” of our 
design and wanted easier access to the page with direct interaction on a certain 
recipe. For this reason, we included obvious accessibility to our community engagement
page that would link to a discussion board on the recipe the baker just made.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### A More Complete Recipe Editing Process

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8002,
        alt: "Final paper prototype that shows how users can get help from community experts and refine their recipe!",
    }}
    caption={
        "Final paper prototype that shows how users can get help from community experts and refine their recipe!"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Prior to implementing a simple recipe editing process, our design simply let bakers 
give a rating to a recipe that could lead to editing. During our heuristic evaluation 
and usability tests,  our participants did not find the editing buttons during the 
feedback process and gave feedback that they were unsure whether the feedback was for 
themselves or the recipe. This implies that the intention of these pages could be unclear 
to potential bakers. We revamped the feedback process to include both feedback for the 
recipe and a personal rating with the ability to comment for both and clear buttons 
for the editing in our digital design.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Resulting Design

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x6002,
            alt: "Different steps of a recipe and to choose from for the users and they can rate their difficulty level for each steps.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x6001,
            alt: "Different steps of a recipe and to choose from for the users and they can rate their difficulty level for each steps.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Different steps of a recipe and to choose from for the users and they can rate their difficulty level for each steps."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The latest iteration of our digital interface reveals a user-centric design that streamlines the 
culinary journey, featuring a linear baking quest path to enhance navigation and engagement. 
The revamped interface includes a nuanced star rating system for recipe complexity, allowing users 
to intuitively select recipes that match their skill level, as showcased in the visuals. 
The user experience is elevated through a simplified feedback process, enabling bakers to provide and
view responses with ease, as illustrated in the accompanying images.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x3002,
            alt: "This is a complete digital mockup of the process of what happens when the user actually starts baking a croissant -- the goal steps, digital tools for better usability & accessibility and so on!",
            caption: "This is a complete digital mockup of the process of what happens when the user actually starts baking a croissant -- the goal steps, digital tools for better usability & accessibility and so on!"
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x3001,
            alt: "Users get to connect with community and refine the recipes according to the suggestions!",
            caption: "Users get to connect with community and refine the recipes according to the suggestions!"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"200px"}
>

In the refined feedback section, bakers can now gauge their performance alongside the recipe's 
effectiveness, supported by a dual-rating system captured in the screenshots. This allows for targeted
enhancements and fosters a community-centric approach to culinary mastery. The inclusion of a digital
scale interface, as depicted, integrates technology with traditional baking, offering precision and 
efficiency. Altogether, these digital advancements form a comprehensive baking assistant, enriching 
the connection between the baker and the broader cooking community.
