## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

In an era where rapid online communication is vital, it's surprisingly easy to overlook replying to messages. 
Studies reveal that while 50% of electronic replies occur within an hour, the remainder can extend to days, 
leading to unintentional neglect. Our project, Mindful Messenger, aims to address this issue by helping users 
become more aware of their response times, thereby improving their communication habits and reducing the stress 
of digital interactions.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

### Unraveling Texting Habits: A Study at the University of Washington

We embarked on a comprehensive study involving interviews and surveys with computer science students, aiming to delve
into the underlying reasons behind poor texting habits. This approach provided both qualitative insights from interviews
and quantitative data from surveys, helping to validate initial observations and uncover patterns in texting behavior.

#### The Workflow of Responding

The process of replying involves several factors: urgency assessment, relationship understanding, mood/availability, and the thought required for response. This workflow determines the prioritization of text responses.

#### Diverse Reactions to Response Times

Reactions to delayed responses vary greatly, from anxiety and annoyance to indifference, especially influenced by the relationship's nature.

#### Technology as an Aid

Some participants utilized message tracking features in their apps, highlighting a need for more sophisticated solutions.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

### Crafting a Solution: From Concept to Reality

Our approach involved an iterative design process focusing on mobile integration, due to its ubiquity in our target demographic's daily communication.

#### Task Design and Rationale

We concentrated on two main tasks: enabling users to set response time goals and providing automated response advice. This approach aims to alleviate response paralysis and enhance communication efficiency.

#### Smart Integration

Besides mobile apps, smart home integrations were considered to provide reminders and response assistance in a non-intrusive manner.

#### Storyboard Insights

1. **Message Response Time Tracking**: A scenario depicting the use of our app in tracking response times with a new acquaintance.
2. **Automated Response Advice**: Illustrating how the app assists in crafting replies for complex conversation topics.

Streamlined Bulk Usability

- During the initial rounds of the paper prototype testing process, our participants posed the question: How can I add multiple contacts? This lack of functionality in our feature space was hugely overlooked during our rapid design process, and this realization drove the development of a significant amount of new pages and components that leaned into the flexibility and efficiency of use heuristics. Additionally, during the second round of paper prototype usability testing, a similar idea was mentioned that individually customizing the reminder setting thresholds for each new contact would be inefficient. From this, we added our bulk select, group reminder setting editing, and editing features that are pieces of functionality that are now core to our design.

Clarity of the Reply Space

- Another uncovered aspect when conducting the second round of paper prototype testing was a lack of clarity in how one can access and view existing messages that are in need of responses. One of our participants voiced confusion about where the actual response generation button was, and also how to even navigate to the specific message in the first place. Initially, we only had four main app page tabs, yet after careful ideation when iterating our design into the digital mockup form, we realized that adding another page that housed solely the replies created a stronger clarity towards the reply generation feature for users.

Technology Context Integration

- We were solely focused on developing the reply generation process during our initial iterations that we overlooked the notion that our users may simply need an opportunity to navigate from a reply message into the native messaging application. This “Go To Message” functionality in conjunction with the core generation feature was a suggestion that one of our paper prototype usability testing participants suggested, and it felt like such a clear and meaningful addition to our design. This idea leans into the notion of MessageMinder functioning more as a tool that empowers users to navigate to responding to messages at a consistent level, and it was interesting to discover how we overlooked this core idea in our initial design.

### Mindful Messenger: A Tool for Effective Digital Communication

Our final design encompasses a mobile application integrated with smart home devices. The primary features include tracking message response times and suggesting responses to facilitate timely and thoughtful communication.

- **Feature 1**: User-configurable response time goals with progress tracking.
- **Feature 2**: Automated advice for crafting appropriate responses in complex conversations.
