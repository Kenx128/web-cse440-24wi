## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

<ProjectImageBlock

        src: problemDesignOverview,

Long distance relationships, everyone has heard about them, experienced them, 
or seen a depiction of them. But in college, a lot of people are forced 
to navigate the newfound distance between them and their parents for 
the first time. However, only roughly 41% of college students communicate 
with their parents daily. This can take a toll on parent-child relationships 
and cause strain on relationships that are navigating this new distance. 

That’s where OrcaPod comes into play. OrcaPod allows participants to 
track multiple conversations with a person’s parent or children 
across multiple time zones. In turn, this allows participants to keep 
their parent or child involved in their lives even while apart. OrcaPod 
provides an interactive and creative way for parents and children to 
stay connected even if they may not be able to physically see each other.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

When designing our solution, we focused on three main things during the 
research process: problems, reasons, and solutions. In a more in-depth 
approach, identifying issues that lead to a lack of communication between 
a parent and child, reasons for the lack of communication, and potential 
solutions to fix the communication gap. 

People have different reasons and issues that come up when it comes to 
keeping their parent or child involved in their lives. For example, an 
international student might struggle to keep their parents involved in 
their life because of the difference in time zone or a student could be 
in the middle of exams and don’t have the mental or physical capacity to 
communicate with their parent(s) at the time. Similarly, how we then attempt 
to solve these issues needs to match the motivations of both parents and their 
children, or else we risk creating a one-sided or worse, a solution nobody wants.

For our design research, we chose to do three interviews because this 
allowed us to have an in-depth conversation with people in our stakeholder 
groups and narrow down our problem space. During our interviews, we asked 
the participants multiple questions relating to their communications with 
their parents or children from whom they live away from. For example, we 
explored the reasons why some of the participants tend to neglect communicating 
with their parents or children and their daily schedules which leads to a 
lack of communication. 

We chose to focus on international college students, students who live away 
from home, and parents of students away from home. This gave us a dual problem 
approach to navigating how to bridge communication issues between parents and 
students who live away from home.

### Technological Knowledge Differences

During our interview with the student who lived away from home in Washington, 
we learned that they didn’t favor using complicated apps to communicate with 
their parents while they lived away from home because their parents had a limited 
understanding of technology. 

### Lack of Emotions and Depth when Texting

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "Caption for just this image. It stays with this image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x400,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "Caption for just this image. It stays with this image.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

From our interview with the international student, we found out that they struggled 
with fully expressing their emotions through texts and wished for a better way to 
communicate their thoughts and emotions with their parents from across the world.

### Holidays and Traditions at the Core of Some Family Dynamics

In our interview with the parent and the student living away from home in Washington, 
they expressed a desire for wanting to continue ethnic traditions and holidays with 
their parents. Both participants wanted to find ways to continue getting together with 
their families to celebrate these holidays and traditions or find a way to celebrate 
virtually when they couldn’t. 

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

Our design focus was primarily on enhancing user interaction with the Home HubBoard, 
specifically by improving communication across different time zones and ensuring 
clear communication when one party is unavailable. We iteratively refined the alarm 
setting process, making it more intuitive with a scroll wheel and gridded message 
boxes for better organization. These design iterations were informed by usability 
tests that revealed users' preferences for more familiar interaction methods, 
leading to the inclusion of touchscreen capabilities and voice input to accommodate 
varying user needs. These changes aimed to streamline the communication process, 
making it more inclusive and responsive to our user base.

### Favorability within Modes in different Demographics

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: byransPod,
            alt: "The pod screen Bryan sees for Elizabeth",
            caption: "Bryan is a young participant communicating with their parent, Elizabeth.",
        },
        {
            src: elizasPod,
            alt: "The pod screen Elizabeth sees Bryan.",
            caption: "Elizabeth is an older participant communicating with their child, Bryan.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Based on our usability tests, we found that younger participants prefer touch 
functionality, while older participants favor stylus functionality when using 
the smartboard or tablet. Additionally, younger users prefer using a keyboard to 
input text, whereas older participants prefer a combination of writing and voice 
features for text input.

### Need for Organization and Navigation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: fppGridlines,
            alt: "Final paper prototype gridlines",
            caption: "Final paper prototype added gridlines to assist with participant's navigations.",
        },
        {
            src: ashleysPod,
            alt: "The pod screen Elizabeth sees for Ashley.",
            caption: "Digital prototype added gridbox to assist with participant's navigation.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During our prototype testing, participants often lacked guidance on what actions to take. 
There were many questions regarding the functions and meanings of various buttons on 
our smartboard. Our design offered too much freedom and caused participants to become 
lost and struggle with navigation. Allowing participants to input anything on the 
smart board also resulted in too much clutter and confusion on the screen, making it 
harder to use.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Error Prevention & Option to Undo

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
        alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
    }}
    caption={
        "This is a caption."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

There were moments we discovered where the participants entered unexpected numbers or 
words because our design lacked restrictions on input. We lacked a method to undo these 
messages, which meant they remained permanently on the smartboard, and this took away 
from the participant's experience.
